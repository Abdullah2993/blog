Wrote my first ever computer program in `GW-BASIC` (contrary to what it may seem, I'm not that old) then found a course book on `C` so `printf` it was which eventually turned to `cout<<cin` and then I found the holly grail of `VB.NET` and  for quite I while it was all `Dim` this `Dim` that and the love of drag and drop GUI started taking over me but that english like syntax of `VB.NET` didn't made me feel like a programmer at all. The love for curly braces `{}` made me switch to the rather popular(depends) sibling, `C#` which had all the same qualities of `VB.NET` but had `{}` hurray and then it was `C#/ASP.NET` for a while. During that time I somehow encountered `java`, working a lil bit with `java` made me love `C#` even more. At the same time I developed a deep hatred for anything that had the word `java` in it. With time `C#` improved and made life much more easier with things like `async/await` but just like many others I fingered almost every language there is even `verilog` and eventually even `java`(damn android).  
Anyways now days I'm mostly working with `GO` or `Python` with an occasional touch of `C#`(.NET Core), `java`(android) and `js/Typescript`(depending upon the mood).
